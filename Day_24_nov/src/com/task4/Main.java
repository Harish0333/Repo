/*Imagine you are developing a class to model a MobilePhone for a mobile device management system. 
  To accommodate different scenarios of creating mobile phone objects, you decide to employ constructor overloading.

Instructions:

Implement a default constructor for the MobilePhone class that initializes default values for the brand, model, 
and operating system.

Create a parameterized constructor that takes the brand and model as parameters, allowing the instantiation of a mobile phone 
with the specified brand and model while assigning a default value for the operating system.

Extend the MobilePhone class with another parameterized constructor that includes all three parameters: brand, model, 
and operating system. This constructor should enable the explicit specification of the operating system when creating a 
MobilePhone object.

Overload the constructor further by adding a new variant that takes the brand, model, operating system, and storage capacity. 
This constructor should provide the option to include the storage capacity as part of the mobile phone's details.

Demonstrate the use of these overloaded constructors in the main method of a separate class. Create instances of the MobilePhone 
class using different constructors, showcasing scenarios where only basic information or additional details, 
such as the operating system or storage capacity, are provided during object creation.

Note: Follow Java naming conventions, use appropriate data types, and provide necessary accessor methods in the MobilePhone class.*/
