/*Develop a Java program to model an e-commerce system that demonstrates the relationship between a Customer and their associated ShoppingCart, 
  emphasizing the concept of aggregation.

Create a Customer class with private attributes for the customer's name, email, and unique customer ID. Implement a parameterized constructor 
to set these attributes during the instantiation of a Customer object. Provide necessary accessor methods.

Develop a ShoppingCart class with private attributes for the cart int type ID and a  String type item. Implement a parameterized constructor 
for the ShoppingCart class that initializes the cart ID.

Establish a HAS-A relationship between the Customer and ShoppingCart classes by including an instance of the ShoppingCart class as a 
private attribute within the Customer class. Ensure that a Customer object is associated with a specific ShoppingCart object.

Implement a method in the ShoppingCart class to add items to the cart. This method should take parameters representing the items to be added 
and manage the individual item slots within the cart. Ensure that the cart cannot hold more than three items.

In the main method of a separate class:
Create an instance of a Customer with a unique ID, name, and email.
Instantiate a ShoppingCart associated with this customer.
Demonstrate the aggregation relationship by adding various items to the customer's shopping cart and displaying the contents of the cart.
Ensure adherence to Java naming conventions, employ proper encapsulation, and provide necessary accessor methods.*/
