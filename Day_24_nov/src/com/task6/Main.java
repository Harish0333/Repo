/*In the context of a banking application, you are tasked with designing a class to represent a BankAccount. 
 * To ensure flexibility in creating bank account objects, constructor overloading becomes crucial.

Instructions:
Implement a default constructor for the BankAccount class that sets default values for the account holder's name, account number, and balance.
Create a parameterized constructor that takes the account holder's name and account number as parameters. 
This constructor should allow the instantiation of a bank account with the specified name and 
account number while assigning a default value for the balance.

Extend the BankAccount class with another parameterized constructor that includes all three parameters: 
account holder's name, account number, and balance. This constructor should enable the explicit specification of the initial balance 
when creating a BankAccount object.

Overload the constructor further by adding a new variant that takes the account holder's name, account number, balance, 
and an interest rate. This constructor should provide the option to include the interest rate as part of the account details.

Demonstrate the use of these overloaded constructors in the main method of a separate class. Create instances of the BankAccount class 
using different constructors, showcasing scenarios where only basic information or additional details, 
such as the initial balance or interest rate, are provided during object creation.*/
